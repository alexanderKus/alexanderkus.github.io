3 months ago I purchased a subscription at [codecrafters.io](https://codecrafters.io) and this post is a summary of challenges I completed or tried to. See the list below.

Finished:
- Http server
- Dns server
- BitTorrent client

Started:
- Redis 
- SqlLite

I found those challenges to be satisfying and interesting. Some stages took me a way more time than I thought they would, and some less, but nevertheless I gained a deeper understanding of how this things work under the hood.

All code is present on my github.
