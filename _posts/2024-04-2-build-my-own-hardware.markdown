title:  "Build my own hardware. Part 0"
---

Back in the day I was wondering about hardware. I wanted to understade how it works from transistor level to first lines of code in C lets say.
So what is the best way of learning if not by doing? 
Fistly I need to acquire a programmable hardware. let's go with [FGPA][FPGA-wikipedia] board. I have never played with one before, but I have watched a George Hotz's stream, where he was
implementing [RISC-V][RISC-V-wikipedia] architecture on FGPA with language called [Verilog][Verilog-wikipedia]. I will do the same thing, but I will not stop there. Let's go further. Making a LED turn on and off
seen to be fun and simple enough for now. That programm will be written in C. C is the real hero they say!


# Hard part:

I do not kwon Verilog or FPGA or RISC-V architecutre at all.
