# Choosing hardware

When it come to choosing hardware my kwonledge and experience is limited. 
I did some digging and decided to go with popular 
[ICEStick](https://www.digikey.pl/en/products/detail/lattice-semiconductor-corporation/ICE40HX1K-STICK-EVN/4289604). 
Fun part is that it costs $140! which for me is 600 PLN, when some time ago it cost around $25.
What happened?!
