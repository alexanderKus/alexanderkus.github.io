title:  "Advenf of code 2024"

End of the year is a time for Christams and of [Adent of Code](https://www.adventofcode.com).
I am happy to say that for the first time I I managed to complete all the puzzles. 
I'd be lying if I said I had no problems solving the puzzles. 
[Graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory) is weirdly eazy to forget... Maybe it's time to revisit [that book](https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf).
